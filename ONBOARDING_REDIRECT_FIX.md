# Onboarding Redirect Fix

## Issue

Users who had already completed onboarding could still access the `/onboarding` page by directly navigating to the URL, even though they should be redirected to the dashboard.

## Root Cause

The onboarding page (`src/app/onboarding/page.js`) was not checking whether the current user had already completed onboarding before rendering the onboarding flow.

## Solution

### 1. Added Onboarding Status Check

Added a new effect to check if the authenticated user has already completed onboarding:

```javascript
// Check authentication and onboarding status
useEffect(() => {
  const checkOnboardingStatus = async () => {
    if (authLoading) {
      return; // Still loading auth state
    }
    
    if (!user) {
      router.push("/auth/login");
      return;
    }
    
    try {
      // Check if user has completed onboarding
      const userProfile = await getUserByUID(user.uid);
      
      if (userProfile && userProfile.onboardingCompleted) {
        // User has already completed onboarding, redirect to dashboard
        console.log("User has already completed onboarding, redirecting to dashboard");
        router.push("/dashboard");
        return;
      }
      
      // User hasn't completed onboarding, allow access to onboarding page
      setCheckingOnboarding(false);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error checking onboarding status:", error);
      // If there's an error, assume they need onboarding
      setCheckingOnboarding(false);
    }
  };
  
  checkOnboardingStatus();
}, [user, authLoading, router]);
```

### 2. Added Loading State

Added `checkingOnboarding` state to show loading while checking onboarding status:

```javascript
const [checkingOnboarding, setCheckingOnboarding] = useState(true);

// Show loading while checking authentication and onboarding status
if (authLoading || checkingOnboarding) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-[#f0f7ff] flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-center">
        <div className="mb-4">
          <Image
            src="/logo/techterview_symbol_colored.png"
            alt="TechTerview Logo"
            width={80}
            height={80}
            className="mx-auto"
          />
        </div>
        <p className="text-gray-600">Loading...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Enhanced AuthGuard

Also improved the `AuthGuard` component to use `usePathname` instead of `window.location.pathname` for better Next.js integration:

```javascript
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';

// In the component
const pathname = usePathname();

// Check if user is on onboarding page but has already completed it
if (!requireOnboarding && profile && profile.onboardingCompleted && 
    pathname === '/onboarding') {
  router.push('/dashboard');
  return;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Flow for Completed Users

1. **User navigates to `/onboarding`** (manually or via URL)
2. **Authentication check**: Verifies user is logged in
3. **Onboarding status check**: Fetches user profile from Firestore
4. **Redirect check**: If `onboardingCompleted: true`, redirects to `/dashboard`
5. **Result**: User cannot access onboarding page after completion

### Flow for Incomplete Users

1. **User navigates to `/onboarding`**
2. **Authentication check**: Verifies user is logged in  
3. **Onboarding status check**: Fetches user profile from Firestore
4. **Access granted**: If `onboardingCompleted: false` or missing, shows onboarding
5. **Result**: User can complete onboarding process

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Completed User Trying to Access Onboarding
```
1. User completes onboarding → redirected to /dashboard
2. User manually navigates to /onboarding
3. Expected: Automatically redirected back to /dashboard
4. Result: ✅ User cannot access onboarding after completion
```

### Test 2: Incomplete User Accessing Onboarding
```
1. User signs up → redirected to /onboarding  
2. User starts onboarding process
3. Expected: Can complete all onboarding steps
4. Result: ✅ User can access and complete onboarding
```

### Test 3: Unauthenticated User Accessing Onboarding
```
1. User not logged in navigates to /onboarding
2. Expected: Redirected to /auth/login
3. Result: ✅ User must authenticate first
```

### Test 4: Direct URL Navigation
```
1. Completed user types /onboarding in address bar
2. Expected: Brief loading, then redirect to /dashboard
3. Result: ✅ Cannot bypass onboarding completion check
```

## Benefits

✅ **Security**: Prevents completed users from re-accessing onboarding
✅ **Data Integrity**: Ensures onboarding data isn't accidentally overwritten
✅ **User Experience**: Smooth redirects without confusion
✅ **Route Protection**: Comprehensive checking at both page and guard level
✅ **Performance**: Efficient checks with proper loading states

## Files Modified

- `src/app/onboarding/page.js` - Added onboarding completion check
- `src/components/AuthGuard.jsx` - Enhanced path checking with usePathname

The onboarding page now properly protects against unauthorized access by completed users while maintaining a smooth experience for users who need to complete onboarding.

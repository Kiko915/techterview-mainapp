# Onboarding Validation Documentation

## Overview

The onboarding process now includes comprehensive validation to ensure all required information is collected before completion. Users cannot proceed to the next step or complete onboarding without filling in all required fields.

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields

All of the following fields are **required** to complete onboarding:

1. **Username** (Step 2) - Must not be empty or whitespace only
2. **Full Name** (Step 2) - Must not be empty or whitespace only  
3. **Role** (Step 3) - Must select either "Recruiter" or "Candidate"
4. **Skill** (Step 4) - Must select from: Frontend Development, Backend Development, or UI/UX
5. **Experience Level** (Step 5) - Must select from: Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert

## Validation Behavior

### Step-by-Step Validation

Each step validates its required fields when the user clicks "Next":

#### Step 2: Basic Information
- **Validates**: Username and Full Name are not empty
- **Error**: Red Alert component: *"Please fill in both username and full name."*
- **Result**: Stays on current step until fields are completed

#### Step 3: Role Selection
- **Validates**: A role has been selected
- **Error**: Red Alert component: *"Please select your role."*
- **Result**: Stays on current step until role is selected

#### Step 4: Skill Selection
- **Validates**: A skill area has been selected
- **Error**: Red Alert component: *"Please select your skill area."*
- **Result**: Stays on current step until skill is selected

#### Step 5: Experience Level
- **Validates**: An experience level has been selected
- **Error**: Red Alert component: *"Please select your experience level."*
- **Result**: Stays on current step until experience level is selected

### Final Validation (Step 6: Review)

The review step includes comprehensive validation:

#### Visual Indicators
- **Complete fields**: Displayed in normal gray text
- **Missing fields**: Displayed in red text with "*Required" label
- **Warning message**: Red banner appears when fields are incomplete

#### Submit Button Behavior
- **Disabled state**: Button is disabled when any required field is missing
- **Enabled state**: Button is only enabled when all fields are complete
- **Double validation**: Even if somehow enabled, clicking performs final validation before submission

#### Error Handling
If validation fails during submission:
- **Alert**: *"Please complete all required fields before finishing onboarding."*
- **Action**: Prevents submission and keeps user on review step

## User Experience

### Progressive Validation
1. **Step 1**: Welcome screen (no validation needed)
2. **Step 2**: Must complete username and full name to proceed
3. **Step 3**: Must select role to proceed  
4. **Step 4**: Must select skill area to proceed
5. **Step 5**: Must select experience level to proceed
6. **Step 6**: Shows all information with visual indicators for missing fields

### Visual Feedback

#### Step 6 Review Display
```
Basic Information
✅ Username: johndoe
❌ Full Name: Not provided *Required

Role & Experience  
✅ Role: Candidate
❌ Skill: Not selected *Required
✅ Experience Level: Intermediate
```

#### Warning Banner
When fields are incomplete, a red warning banner appears:
> ⚠️ Please complete all required fields marked with * before finishing onboarding.

#### Button States
- **Complete Onboarding** button is grayed out and unclickable until all fields are valid
- Button shows "Saving..." during submission
- Button returns to normal state if submission fails

## Implementation Details

### Validation Functions

```javascript
// Overall form validation
const isFormValid = () => {
  return (
    formData.username.trim() !== "" &&
    formData.fullName.trim() !== "" &&
    formData.role !== "" &&
    formData.skill !== "" &&
    formData.experienceLevel !== ""
  );
};

// Step-specific validation
const isStep2Valid = () => {
  return formData.username.trim() !== "" && formData.fullName.trim() !== "";
};

const isStep3Valid = () => {
  return formData.role !== "";
};

const isStep4Valid = () => {
  return formData.skill !== "";
};

const isStep5Valid = () => {
  return formData.experienceLevel !== "";
};
```

### Form Submission
The final submission includes validation:

```javascript
const handleFinish = async () => {
  if (!user) return;
  
  // Final validation check
  if (!isFormValid()) {
    alert("Please complete all required fields before finishing onboarding.");
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with submission...
};
```

## Benefits

✅ **Data Integrity**: Ensures complete user profiles
✅ **Better UX**: Clear feedback on what's missing
✅ **Progressive Validation**: Catches issues early in the process
✅ **Visual Guidance**: Red text and warnings guide users to incomplete fields
✅ **Prevents Incomplete Profiles**: Cannot proceed without all required information
✅ **Consistent Validation**: Same rules apply at each step and final submission

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Incomplete Step Progression
1. Leave username empty on Step 2
2. Click "Next"
3. **Expected**: Alert message, stays on Step 2

### Test 2: Incomplete Final Submission
1. Complete Steps 1-4 but skip Step 5
2. Go to Step 6 (Review)  
3. **Expected**: Red warning banner, disabled submit button

### Test 3: Complete Onboarding
1. Fill all required fields
2. Go to Step 6 (Review)
3. **Expected**: No red warnings, enabled submit button
4. Click "Complete Onboarding"
5. **Expected**: Successful submission, redirect to dashboard

### Test 4: Visual Validation
1. Complete some fields, leave others empty
2. Go to Step 6 (Review)
3. **Expected**: Complete fields in gray, incomplete fields in red with "*Required"

The validation system ensures a smooth, guided onboarding experience while maintaining data quality.

# Web Accessibility

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

## WCAG Principles

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents.

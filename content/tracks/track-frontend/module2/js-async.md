# Asynchronous JavaScript

JavaScript is single-threaded, but it handles asynchronous operations using the Event Loop.

## Promises

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

## Async/Await

Async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of promises. It makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code.

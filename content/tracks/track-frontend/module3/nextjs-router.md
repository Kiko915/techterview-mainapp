# Next.js App Router

The App Router is a new paradigm for building applications using React's latest features like Server Components and Streaming.

## Key Concepts

- **Server Components**: Render on the server for better performance.
- **Client Components**: Interactive components (`'use client'`).
- **Routing**: File-system based routing in the `app` directory.

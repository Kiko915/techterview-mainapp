# React Hooks

Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Common Hooks

- `useState`: Manage local state
- `useEffect`: Side effects (data fetching, subscriptions)
- `useContext`: Context API
- `useReducer`: Complex state logic
- `useRef`: Mutable values without re-rendering
